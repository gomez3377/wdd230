        <h2>About Rupert</h2>
        <p>
          The City of Rupert is the county seat of Minidoka County and its
          largest city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rupert is strategically located 45 miles from Twin Falls, Idaho, 160
          miles from Boise, Idaho and 180 miles from Salt Lake City, Utah. The
          City is easily accessible to Interstate 84 which is only 4.5 miles
          from the city center; the interstate road system is accessed via State
          Highway 24 and State Highway 25. These two highways provide two
          separate access points to I-84. All of the City’s commercial and
          industrial areas are therefore easily accessed by this
          well-established road system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The center of Rupert’s Historic Business District is listed on the
          National Register of Historic places and surrounds a beautiful town
          square, also on the historic register. The Historic Rupert Square is
          an active place featuring many business and community events
          throughout the year.

        <h2>Historical Fact</h2>
        <p>
          Rupert became a village in 1904. It was originally called Wellfirst
          because it had the only well within miles and people traveled long
          distances to get their supply of water from the well, which was
          located in the middle of the Historic Rupert Square Park. An employee
          of the railroad brought mail to the settlers in 1904, whose name was
          John Henry Rupert. The railroad put the name Rupert on his mailbag and
          soon the town was named Rupert. The first post office was established
          in July of 1905 and W.N. Schilling was the first Postmaster, who also
          opened the Rupert Mercantile Companying May of 1905 on the west side
          of the square. Rupert was platted by engineers of the Reclamation
          Service. The Village of Rupert was incorporated on April 12, 1906.
          M.M. Mackay was Rupert's first Mayor.

        <h2>Welcome to Christmas City, USA</h2>
        <img src="" alt="placeOfInterestImg" />
        <p>
          It’s common to see communities all around Idaho celebrating the
          holidays in their own special way. However, there’s only one town in
          the Gem State that’s actually earned the nickname of “Christmas City,
          USA!” Rupert is a quaint town in Minidoka County that seems pretty
          quiet, but it takes on an entirely new character as the holidays roll
          around. Not only does it get all dressed up in lights, but community
          events and attractions are abundant during this time of year.
