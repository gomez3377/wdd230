        <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
        <article>
          <p>White space is important if you want to make a website look great.
            White space is unsed space in a website. With white space, you improve the
            readability of your webage because you give each element breathing space so
            that it is easier for the eyes to read them. Apple's webpage is a perfect example of
            using white space to add emphasis on their product they are selling.

        <h2>Contrast</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Contrast is used in web design to places emphasis on a element on a webpage. You can place contrast by
            using contrasting colors such as white or a lighter text on a black or darker background. You can use contrast 
            with putting a smaller object next to a larger object or using a differnt font style next to a different but complemtary font style.
            One good example of contrast is Crumbl Cookies webpage. They use contrast to create a hierachy between the different elements. They made the video 
            of the cookies they sell the biggest so that they can draw the user to crave the cookie and immdiatly turn to the black button with white text that says order now.

        <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Hick's Law states that the more choices that is offered to a user then they will spend more time
            trying to make a choice. You want to make your users life easier by making your webpage easy to navigate
            through by reducing the number of options and making your homepage simple. For example with Thursday Boots
            the page is simplified by the first two buttons you see is whether you are shopping for men's boots or women's
            boots. Thursday Boots' don't throw every picture of every product they sell out of the gate but instead just lead users to 
            filter down their choice of boots they are looking for them making their shopping experience go smooth for them.
